# Release notes

## Release1.13

- Increased the stationary target swing window to cover the live client's
  center-to-collision-envelope distance. Release1.12 was still waiting at
  2.2/2.0 units for a Mimic, so it never reached the attack hold.
- The character remains at the saved hunt point and faces the target while the
  attack hold starts inside the expanded window.
- Validation: Release build, offline self-test, and ranged UI check passed.

## Release1.12

- Fixed stationary Mimic, Pulkhan, Tribal, and Tower targets being held in a
  wait state when their center was near but just outside the configured melee
  stop. The swing gate now includes the verified melee attack distance and a
  small target collision allowance, while navigation remains stationary.
- The live status now reports the effective melee swing distance in the wait
  message, making range decisions visible during a hunt.
- Validation: Release build, offline self-test, and ranged UI check passed.

## Release1.11

- Fixed melee attacks being starved when a nearby target moved slightly between
  live reads. The controller now keeps the basic attack held through a short
  melee range and heading correction window, including stationary hunt targets.
- A transient turn response no longer blocks the first swing after the target
  enters melee reach; the next loop continues facing while the attack remains
  active.
- Validation: Release build, offline self-test, and ranged UI check passed.

Windows releases include a **Patch notes** section generated from the commits since the previous release tag. Each release also lists the packaged ZIP and SHA256 sidecar, followed by the current feature and validation notes.

Keep commit subjects specific and user-facing so the generated notes explain what changed without requiring a separate manual edit for every build.
